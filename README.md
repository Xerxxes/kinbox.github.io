## FAQ

# : Does Kinbox have the vulnerabilities I think it does?

Probably not. You can ask us on tiktok or discord. We've been mighty thorough, though.

# : If Kinbox is such a groundbreaking tool it must be hella complex, right?

Actually, it's pretty simple. We're shocked that nobody else made this tool before us. It just goes to show that sometimes, the answer is hidden in plain sight.

# : Isn't Kinbox redundant? It sounds like so many other apps I've heard of.

It shares some similarities to a wide range of apps, but the cleverness of Kinbox is one of a kind. Feel free to reach out to tell us what it reminds you of!
